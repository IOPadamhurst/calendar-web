          <FAQ q={'How is this calendar different from other cloud calendars?'}>
            OI Calendar keeps your data private to you! We, OpenIntents, do not
            store or share any user data or analytics. All data generated is
            stored in each users' own storage buckets, called Gaia Hubs. You as
            a user have control over your own hub with your Blockstack id.

          <FAQ q={'Why not login with Facebook or Google? Or my email?'}>
            Most social media companies are providing you with a free account so
            that they can sell your information to the highest bidder.
            Blockstack is different. With Blockstack, YOU control your identity.
            Neither Blockstack nor the makers of OI Calendar can take the id
            from you or have access to it.
